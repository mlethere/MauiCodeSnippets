  <p align="center">
    I have been having a problem with MAUI. It seems simple enough, but as soon as I want to do something outside of a "101 Coding", I get totally stumped.
    I have therefore decided to maintain by own repository of code snippets to help me remember how to do things. I hope you find it useful too.

    I develop Warehouse Management Systems, so my main knowledge is backend database, C# code, but my UI skills are not great. I am learning MAUI as I go along, so please be patient with me.
