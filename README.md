# Mark Letheren .Net Maui Code Snippets Repository

I've been facing some mental hurdles in migrating from XAML to .NET MAUI. Each time I attempt something new, I often find myself stumped, likely because I lack a solid foundational understanding of the framework.

I am going to create a list of code snippets / examples, based on Microsoft's documentation and then expand upon it.
