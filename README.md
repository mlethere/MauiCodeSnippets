# Mark Letheren .Net Maui Code Snippets Repository

I have been having a bit of a mental challenge migrating from XAML to .Net MAUI. Everytime I try do something I get stumped, and that is typically
caused by not having a very good foundation.

I am going to create a list of code snippets / examples, based on Microsoft's documentaiton and then expanded upon.

## Who am I, Mark Letheren
I am the Vice President of Information Technology & Innovation for Positive Fulfillment Services Ltd. Even though I may not be coding all the time any longer, innovations not only come from observing systems and human behaviours, it also does come from software R&D. Obviously talking and learning are enormously important too.

My strengths are order entry, warehouse management, transport management systems, but anything to do with Warehouse Management, Fulfillment Systems, I have worked on since 1986.
